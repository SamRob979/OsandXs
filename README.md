# OsandXs
A simple game of noughts and crosses (tic-tac-toe) written in C for the command line, use make to compile and test. I'm still learning about github and version control in general so there might be some rought edges here and there. Tested and working on Arch Linux so it will probably work fine on most operating systems. All software is freely avalible under the MIT license.
